# Working with Numbers

### Arithmetic Operators

- As a developer, you will have a lot of tools that you can use to calculate values in JavaScript. This can be helpful in building products for stores, games, or other applications.
- Here are the operators:
- Addition (+): Adds two or more numbers together.
- Subtraction (-): Subtracts one number from another.
- Multiplication (\*): Multiplies two or more numbers.
- Division (/): Divides one number by another.
- Modulus (%): Returns the remainder after division.

- JavaScript follows the standard mathematical rules of precedence (PEMDAS), where multiplication and division are evaluated before addition and subtraction. You can use parentheses to control the order of operations if needed.

### Assignment Operator

- Assignment Operator: Remember, the equal sign, =, is the assignment operator and not a traditional equal sign. This is how you can assign and reassign values in JavaScript!

### Math Object

- Math Object: JavaScript comes with the Math object that provides handy tools for running certain calculations. [Here is the MDN article on the Math Object.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math)

### NaN Value

- NaN stands for "Not-a-Number." It is a special value used to represent the result of an operation that cannot produce a meaningful numeric result. When you perform certain arithmetic operations in JavaScript, the result may be undefined or not a valid number. In such cases, the result is represented as NaN.

### Prep

1. Connect your js file to your HTML file
2. Open your code in the browser and open your console

### Exerise 1 - Reading Code

1. In the `js` file, carefully review the code listed.
2. Answer the questions about the code and run it in the browser.

### Exerise 2 - Operators

1. In the `js` file, complete the activities on using different operators.

### Exerise 3 - Decades Calculator

1. In the `js` file, follow the prompts to calculate the amount of meals you will need to last you for the next decade.

1. In the `js` file, follow the prompts to calculate average scores of each student's subjects.

### Exercise 5 - Weather Converter

1. In the `js` file, follow the prompts to calculate farenheit based on celsius temperatures.

### Exerise 6 - Assigning Values

- You will regularly need to reassign the values of variables based on what you need to be tracking as a user interacts with your program.

1. In the `js` file, follow the prompts to reassign the values of a variable.

### Exerise 7 - Math Object

- The Math Object is a powerful tool for helping you with certain math calculations.
