Exercise 1
Great job on answering the first couple of questions. How would you answer the following?
// How would you change this code to make the value of the quantity variable dynamic?
I actually changed the code itself from the original code written

Exercise 2 and 3 look great!

Exercise 4
Please refactor this to use the math operators (+,-,/,*) instead of the reduce method. This is a great method but we want to make sure you are comfortable using these operators as well.

Exercises 5 - 8 look great! You can uncomment the code, if you would like to

Exercise 9
Please andwer the following question:
// Look up the isNaN() operator in MDN. What does it do? How would you use it?
