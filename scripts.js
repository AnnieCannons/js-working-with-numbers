/********************** Exercise 1  **********************/
// Describe the following code:

const wholesalePrice = 5.45;
const retailPrice = 9.99;
const quantity = 47;
const salesTotal = retailPrice * quantity;
const profit = salesTotal - (wholesalePrice * quantity);

// Where might this code be used?


// Run this code and log the profit variable in the console. What answer do you get?


// How would you change this code to make the value of the quanitity variable dynamic?


/********************** Exercise 2 - Operators **********************/
// Step 1: Calculate the sum of two numbers and log the result.


// Step 2: Calculate the difference between two numbers and print the result.


// Step 3: Calculate the product of two numbers and print the result.


// Step 4: Calculate the result of dividing two numbers and print the result. Handle division by zero.


// Step 5: Check if a given number is even and print the result.



/********************** Exercise 3 - Decades Calculator **********************/
// Store your current age into a variable.
// Store a maximum age into a variable (10 years older than you are now).
// Store an estimated amount per day (as a number).
// Calculate how many you would eat total for the next decade.
// Output the result to the screen like so: "You will need [AMOUNT] to last you until the age of [AGE]".






/********************** Exercise 4 - PEMDAS **********************/
// You are working on an education app and you want to be able to provide the average scores for students.
// Here are the stored variables for a student and their subjects.
const mathScore = 90;
const scienceScore = 85;
const englishScore = 80;
const historyScore = 95;
// How would you get the average of their scores using JavaScript?






/********************** Exercise 5 - Weather Converter **********************/
// Write a calculation that converts celsius to fahrenheit. To get the value of fahrenheit, you have to multiply the celsius value by 9/5 and then add 32. 


// Prompt the user for the value of the temperature in celcius. 


// Run the code so that the following is logged to the console: 25°C is equal to 77°F




/********************** Exercise 6 - Assigning Values  **********************/

// Prompt the user for two numbers.

// Make sure that the values of the variables (the strings) are converted to numbers. 

// Create a new variable, add the numbers, and log the value.

// Reassign the variable to store the values of the numbers being substracted. Log the value.

// Add 100 to the variable. Log the value.

// Divide the value of the variable by 20. Log the value. 






/********************** Exercise 7 - Math Object  **********************/
const decimalNumber = 7.8;
// Given the above variable, how would you round the value to the nearest whole number (using the Math object)?

// Console log the output to check your work.





/********************** Exercise 8 - Math Object  **********************/
// Dice Game
// Create a variable that stores the value of a random number between 1 and 6

// Alert the user of the random number.






/********************** Exercise 9 - NaN  **********************/
const result1 = 0 / 0; 
const result2 = "hello" * 5; 
const result3 = parseInt("abc"); 

// Log the above variables in the console. What is the output?

// Run the following code. How would you edit the following code so that it runs properly?
const value = 4 / 'four';

// Look up the isNaN() operator in MDN. What does it do? How would you use it?
