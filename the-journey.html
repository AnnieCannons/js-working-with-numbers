// I didn't get much chance to use array methods here but this worked. I would be interested in using array methods in order to cut down on some typing / make things more direct and consistely formated for when I get my big-person job one day soon!

// output is an array with seperated variables to call on individually in the next few commands

Adding 100 to the subtracted values equals 102 and then further dividing that subtracted number by 2 equals 51.
